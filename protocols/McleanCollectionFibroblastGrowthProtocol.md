## Thaw, Recover, and Maintain Fibroblasts

### Fibroblast Complete Media
- Minimal Essential Media, NEAA, no glutamine (Life Technologies 10370-088)  
- 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (HyClone, Fisher SH30910.03)  
- 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies 35050-061)  
- 1% Penicillin- Streptomycin (Life Technologies 15070-063)  

### To start a line
1- Place 4 mL of pre-warmed fibroblast complete media in a 15-mL conical.  
2- Remove fibroblasts from liquid nitrogen storage just before use. Transfer on dry ice.  
3- Quickly thaw vial in 37°C water bath.  Ethanol the vial well before opening.  
4- Gently transfer cells to the prepared 15 mL conical using a sterile, plastic 2 ml pipette.  
5- Rinse the vial with 1 mL fibroblast complete media and transfer to the 15-mL conical.  
6- Centrifuge the cells at 1,000g for 3 minutes. A small cell pellet should be visible.  
7- Aspirate the supernatant being careful not to disrupt the cell pellet.  
8- Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL fibroblast complete media using a p1000 micropipette.  
9- Bring up the total volume to 10 mL with fibroblast complete media then transfer cell suspension to a sterile 10-cm dish.  
10- Spread the cells evenly by rocking the plate gently, forward and backward, side to side, and diagonally.  
11- Place the dish into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Do not disrupt the cells overnight.  
12- Replace the media with 10 mL of fresh, pre-warmed fibroblast complete media the next day then change every other day until cells are 90-95% confluent.

## Passaging a line

- Cells should be passaged when the dish is 90-95% confluent using TrypLE Express (Life Technologies 12605-010).  
- We recommend at least three passages before experimental use. It is important to standardize the number of passages for all fibroblast lines in an experimental set to avoid radically different conditions per line.  

13- Cells should never be allowed to reach 100% confluence or to overgrow this point. At confluence cells shift their phase of growth from a log phase to a stationary phase. If this occurs, it is best to start a new vial of cells and watch it more carefully.  
  You cannot re-split a confluent culture and have the cells go back to the way they were prior to confluence. (a number of studies have shown actual gene expression changes at this point of cell growth in a number of different cell lines).

## Plating fibroblast lines for 7510/phalloidin/Bisbenzamide ICC for visualization of mitochondria/actin edge of the cell/ nucleus

- Fibroblasts are plated at a density of 7.9 e3 per cm2 onto 18 mm glass coverslips. We do not use a substrate and the fibroblasts adhere well.  
- MitoTracker-M7510, 125 nM, (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad CA), is used to visualize mitochondria according to manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications (see below).  
- Cytoskeletal integrity is examined staining with Phalloidin-488 (1:500)(Invitrogen # A12379) according to manufacturer’s protocols with minor modifications (see below).  
- Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 3342 trihydrochloride also called bisbenzimide(BB) (2ug/ml) (Sigma #B2261). 2 coverslips per line were mounted in Fluro-Gel aqueous mounting media.

## Detailed protocol of m7510 staining

### 7510 Staining
**It is important to prewarm all solutions used in the live staining of mitochondria by m7510 to 37oC because cold or room temperature solutions can cause the mitochondrial network to fragment.**

1- Fibroblasts were stained 2 days after plating  
2- Pre-warm media used for 7510 staining 15-20 min at 37 ºC  
3- Remove old culture media and add 7510 (125nM 7510 in culture media) to each well. We use 500ul media per well of a 12 well plate but this volume can be changed depending on well size.  
4- Incubate plate for 30 min at 37 ºC in incubator.  
5- Remove staining solution and wash cells 2 times 1 ml each, with media  
6- Fix cells with fresh paraformaldehyde (PFA) that has been warmed up at 37 ºC. We add 1ml per well of 8% PFA /200mM PO4 buffer pH 7.3-7.4 to the 1 ml of media. We do not remove the media from the well prior to adding the fix. 
This gives a final fixative concentration of 4% PFA in 100mM PO4 buffer. Let plate sit in incubator for 10 min.  
7- Remove PFA and wash twice with PBS  
- Fixed plate can be wrapped and stored at 4 degrees or stained for other specific markers.

## Staining fixed cells w/ Phalloidin 488 & Bisbenzimide and Mounting slides for Imaging

### Solutions needed for PH488:
- 1x PBS sterile filtered (0.22um). Need 1 ml / well for 4 total washes.  
- PBS + 0.1% Triton X (50mls PBS + 50ul Triton X).  
  - Note: Triton X is very viscous, so cut the end of the tip off to pipette the solution slowly into pipette.  
  - MIX WELL by inverting or shaking.  
  - Make early so bubbles are gone.  
- 1:500 PH488 in PBS (binds to actin).  
  - Need 1 ml/well, so prepare 13 mls per 12 well plate.  
  - Use 26 ul for a 1:500 dilution in 13 mls of 1x PBS.  

### Staining Fixed Cells w/ PH488 in 12-well plate
- Using a P1000 pipet, remove PBS from the cells and add 1 ml fresh 1x PBS to wash.  
- Let sit for 5 minutes.  
- Remove PBS and add 1 ml Triton X solution using P1000 pipet tip.  
- Let sit for 5 minutes.  
- Remove the Triton X solution and add 1 ml PH488.  
- Let sit for 30 minutes covered in foil on bench.  
- Wash cells w/ 1xPBS three times, with a 5 min incubation period in between. Leave the third wash on the cells.  
- If not performing BB staining same day, cover with microplate cover and parafilm and store at 4C. Label cover that staining has been completed.

### Solutions needed for BB
- 1x PBS sterile filtered (0.22). Will need 1ml/well for 4 washes.  
- PBS + 1:500 BB. Use the 1mg/mL stock solution stored at -20.  
  - Thaw the BB in 37C water bath while agitating for ~30 seconds.  
  - Label Eppendorf tube 1:500 BB (want 2ug/ml final working concentration).  

### Staining Fixed Cells w/ BB in 12-well
- Using a P1000 pipet, remove PBS on cells and add 1 ml fresh 1xPBS.  
- Remove PBS and add 500ul of BB solution.  
- Let sit covered on bench (room temp) for 10 minutes.  
- Wash cells w/ 1xPBS three times, with 5 min incubation period in between. Leave third wash on the cells.  
- If not mounting same day, cover with microplate cover and parafilm and store at 4C. Label cover that staining has been completed.

## Mounting Slides for imaging

1- Prepare slides by dipping into a 50mL conical with 95% EtOH. Wipe dry with a Kim Wipe.  
2- Label w/ pencil on white region: Date, Line # and Passage #, date of plating, concentration of cells, stains (ie PH488, BB), Initials.  
3- Use the P200 to drop up to 30ul of Flurogel mounting media (Fisher # 50-247-04; EMS#17985-10) on the slide for two slips.  
4- Dip the forceps on EtOH and let dry before use.  
5- Use the forceps to remove the slip from the bottom of the plate. Grab as close to the edge as possible.  
6- Dab the edge of the slip on a Kim wipe to blot off excess liquid.  
7- Place “cells side” down on to the slide, slowly to prevent bubbles forming between the mounting media and the slip.  
8- Push coverslip firmly, but gently. Hold for ~10-30 seconds. Cover w/ aluminum foil while the mounting media dries.  
9- Seal with nail polish around the edges of the slips. Then store at 4C protected from light and air.

## Imaging

- 25 fields from each of the two coverslips (50 fields per sample) were imaged with a 40X objective in three independent channels on a Zeiss Axiovert Observer 2.1 with a Colibri 2 LED illumination system.  
- Image acquisition was done with Zeiss Zen 2.0 software.  
- Single channel images were exported as high resolution TIFF files as both color and black and white images as well as one merged 3 color image.  
- Images were visually checked for focus of defined edges on each cellular element to be analyzed. (It was necessary to do a focus offset for the nuclei to get a sharp defined edge).  
- We used an offset for imaging the nuclei so that each field was in sharp focus for subsequent analysis with CellProfiler.  
- Analysis with CellProfiler was done on the 3 independent black and white images from each field.
